# LendingClub Loan Repayment Deep Learning Project Exercise

## Our Goal
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), we build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. 
We also do some data analysis and feature engineering on our way to develop a model.
